# TypeRacer Python Hack

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS
(you can edit the code as you like to make it work for other platforms, it is open source after all)

Setup:
(You will obviously need python installed, I personally run python 3.9.0)
1. You must have Selenium and keyboard installed (pip install selenium | pip install keyboard) 
2. You must have ChromeDriver installed for your version of Chrome https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
3. You need to set ChromeDrivers PATH, here is a YT video on how to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz59GsdvUF8

When the bot is running, you do not need to click on anything in chrome.
