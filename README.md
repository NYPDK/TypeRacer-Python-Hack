# TypeRacer Python Hack

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS
(you can edit the code as you like to make it work for other platforms, it is open source after all)

Setup:
1. You must have Selenium and keyboard installed (pip install selenium | pip install keyboard) 
2. You must have ChromeDriver installed for your version of Chrome https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

3. You need to set ChromeDrivers PATH, here is a YT video on how to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz59GsdvUF8

When the bot is running, you do not need to click on anything in chrome. (unless it is to close the captcha test if the WPM was greater than 100)

Example video showing it running (pre-release build so it is a bit different now)
